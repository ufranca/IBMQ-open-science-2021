    "## I.1 Introduction and Objective of The Open Science Prize\n",
    "\n",
    "From [The Open Science 2021 description](https://github.com/qiskit-community/open-science-prize-2021):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> One of the leading uses for quantum computers will be to simulate quantum systems such as molecules or engineered materials. Actually executing a quantum simulation on a current quantum computer, however, can be difficult and error prone. Your objective for this Open Science Prize is to significantly improve the state-of-the-art for quantum simulation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The quantum system you will simulate is a quantum spin-1/2 model, where each qubit represents a quantum [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) particle in a 1D chain. Quantum spin models have some amazing properties and uses. Computationally speaking, [certain optimization problems can be mapped](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05771.pdf) to spin models and hence minimized on a quantum computer. Physically speaking, spin models show a variety of quantum behavior such as large entangled states, quantum phases of matter, quantum many-body affects, and many other open questions in physics research.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There are many different spin models, but we will focus on the [$XXX$ Heisenberg spin model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Heisenberg_model#XXX_model). Though it is not as well known as the [transverse-field Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse-field_Ising_model), the $XXX$ Heisenberg model is of practical and theoretical interest. It can also be difficult to simulate, which is where you come in.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">[...]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">You are to time evolve the state $|110\\rangle$ to time $t=\\pi$ under the $XXX$ Heisenberg model Hamiltonian $H_{\\text{heis3}}$ as defined in Section 1. This will be done on the ibmq_jakarta quantum computer. From left to right, the qubits in $|110\\rangle$ correspond to ibmq_jakarta's qubits 5, 3, and 1. The evolution must be done using Trotterization with at least 4 steps ($n\\geq4$). You will be judged on the clarity, originiality, and creativity of your solution, as well as the fidelity of the evolved state at time $t=\\pi$ using [state tomography](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/noise/8_tomography.html). State tomography is a way of determining the exact quantum state--even phase information--at the end of a quantum circuit by running the circuit multiple times and measuring in different bases. The closer your final quantum state to the expected state, the higher the fidelity. Ibmq_jakarta's qubits 0, 2, 4, and 6 will not be evaluated by the state tomography calculation, so you may use them as you wish. You do not need to follow the same decomposition given in the example above, but your solution must be a Trotterization of $U_{\\text{heis3}}(t)$ with at least 4 steps ($n\\geq4$). You may find it useful to implement techniques that reduce errors and improve qubit coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## I.2 Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we describe and calculate different approaches and methodologies to evolve the state $|110\\rangle$ to time $t=\\pi$ for the XXX Heisenberg model Hamiltonian. Our approaches use some native gates and  and also pulse efficient gate approaches, with and without measurement error mitigation, to increase the state fidelity of simulations. The simulations are run using the noisy simulator `FakeJakarta()` and the final experiments are run in IBMQ's Jakarta device using the parameters of the simulations with highest fidelity. We show that __a pulse-efficient simulation obtained using the template optimization methodology of [Earnest et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01063) gives state fidelities of $\\approx$ 0.8-0.9__. This will be described in detail in Sec. [V](#V.-Pulse-Efficient-Gates-with-Template-Optimization) with the final Jakarta runs on subsection VI.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized as follows: in Section [II](II.-The-XXX-Heisenberg-Spin-Model) we describe the XXX Heisenberg spin model, the decomposition of the Hamiltonian operator into quantum gates using the Suzuki-Trotterization decomposition. This discussion follows closely the [original notebooks](https://github.com/qiskit-community/open-science-prize-2021) provided by the organizers of the Open Science Prize 2021. Sec. [III](#III.-Qiskit) imports the packages and backends which will be used in the notebook and contains some functions that will be used in the simulations and device executions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent two sections, we use several approaches to simulate the Heisenberg model and compare their results. These tests are run on a Jakarta simulator, `FakeJakarta` and are executed using between 4 and 13 Trotter steps to evaluate their performance with increasing Trotterization. In Sec. [IV](#IV.-Standard-Gates) we use the standard implementation of gates in Qiskit to run 4 different sets of experiments that will provide the baseline to compare the pulse efficient solutions. We perform a noiseless test, a non-optimized quantum circuit execution, an optimized quantum circuit execution, and an optimized quantum circuit execution followed by measurement error mitigation using the Qiskit implementation of measurement calibration. In Sec. [V](#V.-Pulse-Efficient-Gates-with-Template-Optimization) we discuss pulse efficient template optimization and implement this approach to generate pulse efficient versions of the $XX(\\theta)$, $YY(\\theta)$, and $ZZ(\\theta)$ gates. After comparing these gates with their standard, CNOT-implemented counterparts, we demonstrate their performance with and without post-processing of the results by applying measurement error mitigation. Finally, with the result of these experiments, in Sec. [VI](#VI.-Jakarta-Experiments) we execute the circuits with higher performance on `ibmq_jakarta` and report their final results on the actual device. \n",
    "\n",
    "## I.3 Running this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be run either with all `FakeJakarta` simulations to compare methodologies, which takes approximately 1h30-2h because of the large number of executions, or only with the final experiments on the actual Jakarta device. \n",
    "\n",
    "__To execute only the experiments on Jakarta, set the flag below to `run_simulations = False`__ before running the entire notebook. This will skip all simulations but run the Jakarta experiments in Section V. "

    "\n",
    "A final approach using Qiskit's native gates consists in post-processing the results of the simulation using [measurement error mitigation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/noise/3_measurement_error_mitigation.html). While there are many alternative strategies for measurement error mitigation (see, for instance [[Temme et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02058), [Kim et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09197), [Nation et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12518)]), we will use here the measurement calibrations to mitigate measurement errors as implemented in `qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As described in detail in a Qiskit textbook [chapter](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/measurement-error-mitigation.html) and in [this tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/noise/3_measurement_error_mitigation.html), the idea consists in prepare calibration circuits for the full Hilber space and estimate the expectation values of each input states in the other basis states. These results can be used to as a measurement calibration to correct the average results of other experiments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement it, we first generate a list of measurement calibrations for all $2^3=8$ basis input states using `complete_meas_cal`. We can then compute the calibration matrix based on the backend noise. In our case, we will use the noise model from the Jakarta device using `NoiseModel().from_backend(jakarta_backend)` and execute it on `sim_noise_jakarta`. With the results of the calibration matrix, we apply the calibration to the state labels using Qiskit's `CompleteMeasFitter` and generate a filter to be applied to other experiments in the same backend using a measurement filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below, `calculate_meas_filter_noise_from_backend`, implement these steps to return a measurement filter to mitigate the errors in our simulation. For the actual Jakarta experiments, we will define a similar function in Sec. [VI](#VI.-Jakarta-Runs) to return a measurement filter that was obtained directly from a run on the Jakarta backend. \n",

    "As we saw in the previous section, state fidelities using native gates can be somewhat improved using circuit optimization and error mitigation. We could potentially continue improving the accuracy of the simulations even further by using different techniques for error mitigation such as [zero noise extrapolation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/zne.html) ([Temme et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02058), [Kandala et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04492)) using packages such as [mitiq](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/) [[LaRose et al. 2020]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04417) and/or using [quantum error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction) (see ([Wootton 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11037)); for an introduction on quantum error correction using repetition codes, see [this chapter](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/error-correction-repetition-code.html) of Qiskit textbook) . \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will follow yet another approach and use [Qiskit Pulse](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/pulse.html) ([Alexander et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06755)). Qiskit Pulse allows for low-level control of instructions that can in principle be used to design continuous gate implementations with shorter pulse lengths and streamlined circuits. For a recent review of the advantages of pulse-level quantum control, see ([Smith et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13600)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will follow the methodology described in ([Earnest et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01063))\n",
    "to use circuit transpilation with template optimization to obtain pulse-efficient versions of the $XX(2t)$, $YY(2t)$, and $ZZ(2t)$ gates. The idea consists in using the control pulses for the continuous gate set $R_{ZX}(\\theta)$ to create two-qubit gates such as the $R_{YX}(\\theta)$ gate used for the simulation of braiding of Majorana zero modes ([Stenger et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11660)). This method was extended by Earnest _el al._ to allow for the pulse-efficient implementation of arbitrary $SU(4)$ (i.e., 2-qubit) gates. As they describe, \"_the scaled pulses improve gate fidelity without requiring any additional calibration experiments to determine the new values of the pulse parameters._\", because the IBM Quantum systems already uses calibrated CNOT gates built from $R_{ZX}(\\pi/2)$ rotations implemented by the [echoed cross-resonance gate](https://thequantumaviary.blogspot.com/2021/07/how-cross-resonance-gate-works.html) ([Sheldon et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04821), [Sundaresan et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02925)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize this methodology to an arbitrary two-qubit gate $U$ one makes use of Cartan's KAK decomposition ([Zhang et al. 2003](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209120), [Tucci 2005](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507171)). A visual depiction of the KAK decomposition can be seen in the figure below (excerpt from Fig. 2 of ([Earnest et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01063))). The KAK decomposition decomposes the circuit into local ($A_0, A_1, B_0,$ and $B_1$) in panel (a)) and non-local operations (rotations $R_{XX}(\\alpha)$, $R_{YY}(\\beta)$, and $R_{ZZ}(\\gamma)$). These rotations can then be decomposed into a circuit with three $R_ZX$ rotations (panel (c) is an example of such circuit) implemented with a buit-in echo (panel (d)). To generate arbitray two-qubit gates, we can then scale the cross-resonance pulses to create RZX gates for any angles and implement this decomposition ([Stenger et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11660)).\n",

    "With these gates at hand, we can have our gates transpiled to the hardware native $R_{ZX}(\\theta)$ using template substitution ([Iten et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05270)) as implemented by Earnest _et al._ template substitution transpilation pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea behind template substitution is to construct a template, which is a quantum circuit composed by $N$ gates acting on $q_N$ qubits that compose to the identity. The template is then compared to a quantum circuit of interest (in our case, the individual two-qubit rotation gates or the full Trotter circuit). The template substitution transpilation pass then identifies the subset of gates in the template that match this circuit and, based on a dictionary of \"cost\" for each gate, assigns a total cost for the combination of matched gates. If this cost is higher than the cost of the unmatched gates, the matched template is substituted by a new set of gates, leading to shorter templates. Importantly, the echoed cross-resonance implementation of $R_{ZX}$ (Fig. 1c above) is exposed to the transpiler in those decompositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual implementation in IBMQ devices and backend simulators happens in 3 steps (for more details, see appendix A of ([Earnest et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01063))):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Template substitution__: uses `TemplateOptimization` from `qiskit.transpiler.passes` to introduce custom gates with an `rzx` decomposition , such as the rotations `rxx_pe()`, `ryy_pe()`, and `rzz_pe()` defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Simplify gates__: transpiles the circuit obtained from the step above to the `rzx` basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Add custom `rzx` pulse schedule__: uses `RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho` and other `qiskit.transpiler.passes` to create pulse efficient schedules.\n",
    "\n",

    "For this IBMQ Open Science Prize, we were asked to simulate an XXX Heisenberg spin model with 3 spin $1/2$ particles using Jakarta, one of IBM's 7 -qubit quantum computers. Such simulations are particularly important in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era to explore the simulation possibilities of quantum computers and advance the state of NISQ algorithms ([Preskill 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862), [Bharti et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08448)). In this notebook, we walked through different approaches and methodologies to simulate the Hamiltonian and obtain the $|110\\rangle$ state dynamics using both Qiskit native and pulse-efficient gates with and without measurement error mitigation. The results of our different simulations executed on the `FakeJakarta` backend are seen in the figure below.\n",

    "There are alternatives to potentially improve on these results even further. As mentioned when discussing measurement error mitigation on section [4.4](##Native-Gates---Optimization-Level-30-with-Measurement-Error-Mitigation), there are alternative approaches to error mitigation we could implement, such as [zero noise extrapolation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/zne.html) ([Temme et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02058), [Kandala et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04492)) using packages such as [mitiq](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/) ([LaRose et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04417)). This approach has been used successfully in noisy circuits (see, e.g., ([Kandala et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04492), [Kim et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09197))) and it would be interesting to compare its performance with the measurement error strategy used here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative would be to use [quantum error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction) (see ([Wootton 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11037)), particularly repetition codes using the remaining qubits on the Jakarta device to attempt minimizing errors during the calculations. A third approach to improve the state fidelity would be to use compiler modifications that augments the basis gate set using pulse ([Gokhale et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11205), [Smith et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13600)). It will be interesting to implement and verify if these additional approaches improve the fidelity of simulations using noisy quantum processors in the NISQ era. "
